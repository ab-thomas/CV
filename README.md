Abraham Thomas
=========

I'm a Ruby on Rails web developer, based in London. I’m a friendly, professional and committed person, with a passion for experimentation and collaboration. I have a keen eye for detail, and I love problem-solving; writing tests, iterating change, and building functional systems which help users in their day-to-day. I work great as part of a team and I’m also a self-starter, having founded a technology start up on Europe’s only £1million start up accelerator.

People new to coding often find it difficult to explain their code problems in text-form on services such as Stackoverflow. This is because they lack the knowledge and experience to communicate with other developers in a technical way. To lower the barrier to getting help, I conceived askadev.com. Users can submit a video question, as well as their code, and receive a video response. Askadev.com also facilitates live pair-coding, helping people overcome problems quicker and learn faster. 
Technologies used: OAuth from Google and integrated Google hangouts for video. Other technologies include Ruby on Rail, Postgresql JS, jQuery, HTML and CSS.


Interests
---------
I have a passion for technology businesses, and love reading and contributing to conversation online about emerging start ups, new platforms, and innovation in the technology scene. I also love cycling, have a cat, and I paint with oils.

I'm also a fan of digital art and on my Masters degree in Digital Media, I taught myself audio-visual programming using [Max 5](http://cycling74.com/). In an 8-month period, with no previous programming experience, I built a sound-reactive visual application for VJs. I went on to support international DJs with my visual programme in nightclubs in Newcastle.
